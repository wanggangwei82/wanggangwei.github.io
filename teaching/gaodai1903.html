<b>Homework Assignments:</b> 
There will be 
several HW assignments (to be turned in and graded).  The assignments will be posted
at the bottom of this web page.  You will occassionally be required to present solutions to select homework 
problems before your classmates.
<br>
<p><b>Course:</b> Algebraic Techniques for AMCS II: 
We begin  with an introduction to group theory. The emphasis is on groups as symmetries and transformations of space. 
After an introduction to abstract groups and the basic facts about finite groups, we discuss
finite fields and applications to coding theory.   We incorporate some examples using Game Theory and Linear Programming.
Depending on available time, we may also cover the basics of Grobner basis theory.
</p>
<p><b>Text:</b> We will be using Lecture Notes for "Algebra and Applications" by Robert 
Calderbank, copies of which will be passed out the first day of class.   A companion text is "Algebra", 2nd edition,  
by Michael Artin, which is on reserve in the
math/physics library, 3rd floor DRL.  A reference for Game Theory is
<font color="#cc0000">"
Game Theory" </font> by Thomas S. Ferguson, available free online at his
<a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/Game_Theory/Contents.html">
UCLA webpage.</a> 
<br>
<p><b>Exams and Grades:</b>
There will be two hour exams and a final exam.  Each hour exam counts 25% of your grade, and
the final exam counts 40%.  HW and presentations count 10%.  Hour exam 1 will be on Wednesday, Feb. 20 
from 11-11:50am in DRL 4C8, 
and Hour exam 2 will be on Wednesday, April 3, also from 11-11:50am in DRL 4C8. 
The final exam will probably be a take-home exam.
</p>
<p><b>Midterm 1:</b>  Covers material from Lectures 1 through 6 in "Algebra and Applications" lecture notes by 
R. Calderbank, except pages 9-10 from Lecture 1, pages 10-12 from Lecture 4, and pages 3-4 of Lecture 6.
Also includes the game of Nim and the RSA cryptosystem, as discussed in class.
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Midterm 2:</b>  Covers material from Lectures 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 (except for pages 10-12 of lecture 7, pages 12-13 of
lecture 8, and pages 12-13 of lecture 12) in "Algebra and Applications" lecture notes by R. Calderbank.
<br>
<!--
<p><b>Final:</b>  There will be a take-home final exam.  It is the Final Exam in the bcak of the Calderbank Lecture Notes, all problems except #8.  Turn in by 3pm Dec. 22, either under my office door or in my mailbox.
Also includes discussion of
the q-binomial theorem and the number of k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space over
a finite field with q elements.
<p><b>Midterm 2:</b>  Covers II:Sections 4 and 5, (pp. II-33 thru II-56),
III: Sections 1,2,3 (pp. III-1 thru III-24).
</p>
<p><b>Take-Home Final Exam:</b>  Due Dec. 19 by 5pm (can be turned in under my office door, or as a pdf via email).
Problems 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 from the "Final Examination" at the back of the Calderbank lecture notes.
